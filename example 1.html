<p> Mike Edwards - Orginally born in westland, Michiagn on May 20th, 1997. Ive been playing basketball ever since I was 5 years old.
the first oganization I ever played for was at the YMCA. There is where I learned the pure basics of basketball. Fast fowarding all 
way to high school; this is when I started taking basketball a lot more serious then when I did as a kid. I was able to make the varsity 
team my freshman year, which was a big step for me. I grew from 6'6 to 6'9 throughout my first 2 years in highschool, which made it a bit harder 
to maintain my corrdination. I was doing pretty good and was working really hard to become better, and it definetly payed off. The beggining of my junior year,
I recived my first offer from a college, which was Akron University. This put my confidence through the roof and made me want to get more! As my senior year approached,
I decided that I wanted to go out with a bang. The first half of the season went great, which allowed me to get a lot of attention. High Major D1 schools started to
contact me and I was more excited than ever! Georgia was the first school to reach me, and as the season went on, 30 more division 1 schools began to bonbard me. I ended my HS career averaging 
20 pts and 10 rebs a game. The hard part now was deciding which of the 30 schools was going to be best for me. It came down to Georgia, Kansas state, and Nebraska. I was able vvisit all three schools
and my favorite of the three was Georgia. I am now a sophmore in college at UGA and plan to do better things for the program for my future years here.</p>
